### An idealized radiocarbon simulation
Radiocarbon, $^{14}C$, is produced by cosmic rays in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere. It quickly reacts with oxygen to produce 14CO2, which is then mixed throughout the troposphere and enters the ocean through air-sea gas exchange. Because the halflife of radiocarbon is only 5730 years a significant amount of deday can occur before the dissolved inorganic radiocarbon (DI14C) can mix uniformally throughout the ocean. As such the 14C serves as a tracer label for water that was recently in contact with the atmosphere.
Here we will perform an idealized radiocarbon simulation in our model. In this model we prescribe the atmospheric concentration to 1 and model the air-sea gas exchange using a constant piston velocity of $\kappa = $50m/10years. For the radioactive decay we use a timescale of $\tau =$(5730 years)/$\log(2)$.
